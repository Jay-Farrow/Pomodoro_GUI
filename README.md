Pomodoro graphical user interface application, created by following along 100 days of python by Dr. Angela Yu. 
The application simulates the productivity methodology pomodoro, where you work for 25 minutes, then take a 5
minute short break and complete this process for 4 working segments then take a long break of 20 minutes. This
program should help one increase their productivity. 

The graphical user interface includes a clock or timer, which can be intiated by the start button. The timer 
begins in the working segment for 25 minutes, then the short break segment for 5 minutes and finally after the
fourth iteration of the working segments begins the long break of 20 minutes. The user can reset the timer and
begin a new pomodoro run using the reset button.
